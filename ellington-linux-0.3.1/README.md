# Ellington [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AdamHarries/ellington.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AdamHarries/ellington)

Ellington is an experimental project to automate the calculation of beats-per-minute (BPM) information for swing jazz music, such as the works of Duke Ellington - the project's namesake. BPM information for swing jazz music is notoriously hard to calculate automatically, as the shuffle of the rhythm section, the soft/loud chunking guitar, and overall swing feel mean that standard algorithms (which are often optimised for four-on-the-floor feel music) report inaccurate times. As such, this project has two main goals: 

1) Provide a platform for experimenting with various BPM algorithms and tools (machine learning anyone?) in order to find high quality (at least >90% accuracy, 99% of the time) solutions. 

2) Provide a tool, or set of tools, for automatically processing libraries of swing jazz music, and reporting BPM information.

## 30-Second overview

Ellington is based around the idea of a 'library' of audio files, that you might wish to process. This is similar to an iTunes library - you must explicitly add audio files to the library, and where possible metadata is written to the library, not the audio file. 

An example ellington usage flow might be: 

    ellington init library.json -d ~/Music/
    ellington bpm library.json 
    ellington write library.json

The above commands, in order: 
  - Initialise a new ellington library `library.json`
  - Calculate bpm information for each audio file in the library, storing the information in `library.json`
  - Write the bpm information to the audio file comment - where requested (more on this later). 

**NOTE: ELLINGTON IS PRE-ALPHA, AND VERY BUGGY. BACK UP YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY BEFORE USING IT TO WRITE METADATA TO AUDIO FILES!!**

## Dependencies

Most *Ellington* dependencies are expressed using the rust package manager, cargo, and so will be automatically installed when *Ellington* is built. However, *Ellington* makes use of a number of external programs for tasks such as parsing mp3 audio data, or writing id3v2 tags. These are: 
  - ffmpeg
  - id3v2
  - mp4info
  - mp4tags
  
External programs are listed in `src/shelltools`, in case any are missing here. 

## Detailed Usage 

*Ellington* currently supports four different operations (see `ellington --help` for more information): 

  - Library initialisation: `ellington init`
  - BPM calculation: `ellington bpm`
  - Writing ellington metadata to audio files: `ellington write`
  - Clearing ellington metadata from audio files: `ellington clear`

### Library initialisation

Ellington library files can be initialised as follows:

    ellington init <library_file> -d <directory> 
    ellington init <library_file> -i <itunes_xml_library> 
    ellington init <library_file> 

This will write a json-based library to the file given in `<library_file`. Audio discovery is currently possible with three different methodologies. *Ellington* can: 
  - Recursively explore a directory tree to find music files -- `-d <directory>` 
  - Read individual audio file names from stdin -- `-i <itunes_xml_library>`
  - Read an iTunes XML library to discover music files (but not other metadata) -- no further parameters.

### Bpm calculation 

*Ellington* can, given a library file, calculate the bpm of each track in the library using a "pipeline". A pipeline is a combination of an audio decoder (e.g `ffmpeg`), and a bpm algorithm (e.g. `naive`). The results of the bpm calculations are written in place to the library file. This stage can be invoked as follows: 

    ellington bpm <library_file> 

### Metadata writing

*Ellington* files, themselves, are not that useful for the casual DJ. It takes a while to find each song in the JSON, and JSON itself can be a bit tricky to read. In order to remedy this, *Ellington* can write the data that it has calculated to the audio file itself, as follows: 

    ellington write <library_file> 

**NOTE: This will modify metadata of the audio files listed in `library_file`. Run this command at your own risk - it may damage your audio library!**

As the bpms calculated with *Ellington* are not yet high quality, *Ellington* avoids writing to an audio file's `bpm` tag, but instead writes a specially formed piece of text to the comment field of the audio data. *Ellington* is (by default) very polite - it only writes to the comment when requested. 

Comments with *Ellington* metadata contain a valid *Ellington* data string of the form: 

    [ed#<data>#de]

Where `<data>` is a JSON string, with `:` replaced with `#`, representing some *Ellington* data (see `src/library/ellingtondata.rs`).

A good *default* *Ellington* data string is: 

    [ed#{"algs"#{}}#de]

In order to persuade *Ellington* to write to an audio file, edit the 'comment' metadata tag of it to include the above data string, using your tag editor of choice. Alternatively, *Ellington* can be made more aggressive, by passing the `--append` flag to the `write` command. This will append the ellington data to an existing comment even if it does not yet contain comment data. 

## Debugging

By default, *Ellington* is quite conservative in what it prints. In order to get it to log more, export the following environment variable as follows: 

    RUST_LOG=ellington,libellington

## Feature Targets

**0.1.0**: (current master) 
  - Audio file discovery through iTunes based libraries
  - Audio file discovery through recursive directory enumeration
  - Audio file discovery through `stdin`
  - Support for generic audio decoding using `ffmpeg`
  - Support for mp3 tagging using `id3v2`
  - Support for mp4 metadata parsing using `mp4info`
  - Support for mp4 metadata writing using `mp4tags`
  - Naive BPM calculation algorithm acting on raw audio data
  - Draft json-based ellington-data format for ephemeral bpm information
  - Comment appending (i.e. programmatically marking tracks as wanting to have bpm information written to them)

**0.1.1**:
  - Updated/better ellington-data metadata format for audio data tags.

**0.1.2**:

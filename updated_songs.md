# Updated songs
These are the songs I really wanted to have, but the recordings from archive.org and jazz-on-line.com were not the best quality.

## Already updated
Flat feet floogie
Flying home (Hampton, Goodman)
I've heard that song before
Swingin' on nothing
Perdido (Hodges)
Watch the birdie
Shorty's got to go
Love me or leave me
Tuxedo junction
Something to pat your foot to
Yes, indeed
All that meat and no potatoes

## To be updated
Shout, sister, shout!
Jericho (take Natty Congeroo's version from Get on board)
